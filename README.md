# Day Scheduler

## Description

The motivation to implement the project is to create one task for one of the hours for one day which is the current day. It will help users to manage their task for that hour. It solves the problem of users not having to remember what to do for that certain hour. I learned that you can use literals to create a time block and use local storage to store data and display it in the webpage.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
